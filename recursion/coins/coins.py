"""Calculate possible change from combinations of dimes and pennies.

Given an infinite supply of dimes and pennies, find the different
amounts of change can be created with exact `num_coins` coins?

For example, when num_coins = 3, you can create:

    3 = penny + penny + penny
   12 = dime + penny + penny
   21 = dime + dime + penny
   30 = dime + dime + dime

For example:

    >>> coins(0) == {0}
    True

    >>> coins(1) == {1, 10}
    True

    >>> coins(2) == {2, 11, 20}
    True

    >>> coins(3) == {3, 12, 21, 30}
    True

    >>> coins(4) == {4, 13, 22, 31, 40}
    True

    >>> coins(10) == {10, 19, 28, 37, 46, 55, 64, 73, 82, 91, 100}
    True
